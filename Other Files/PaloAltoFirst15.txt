MIND YOUR FIREWALL LOGS

East West traffic (Malware preinstalled on your clients)

ZERO TRUST with security policies

Default Block

Send everything to the firewall first


SECURE THE MANAGEMENT PORT Since it is internet facing

Red Team prevention

Recon (Scanning) aka port detection
Add a zone protection profile (Blocking scanning ip addresses)
Delivery
Check computers for pre installed malware
Configure firewall to block the delivery of known attacks
Command + control
Block malware outgoing traffic

Best practice General


Know what apps to allow in and out of the network and inside of the network. And only allow those to be sent/received
~Implement SSL/SSH description of network packets

Best practice Firewall
Whitelist applications and add them to the security policy
Set up de-encryption policy
Default policy between zones is block
Default policy inside zones is allow
Security policies are stateful
File blocking (.exes)
Add Wildfire signature
First Things to do

Change the cli password
Remove all services other then https, ssh and ping
Delete extra admin users

Look at the services running
Look at the user IDS
Make sure accounts have passwords
Disable ssh and telnet
